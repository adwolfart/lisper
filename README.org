* Lisper

A tiny *WIP* statically typed, immutable, lazy, pattern matched lisp interpreter
in haskell. A micro haskell with lisp semantics to learn Haskell as well as
lisp.

IO can be a compromise for now, I think.

*** Getting started

clone the repo; cd lisper;

1. git clone https://github.com/jaseemabid/lisper && cd lisper
2. cabal sandbox init
3. wget http://www.stackage.org/lts/cabal.config
4. cabal install --only-dependencies
5. cabal build # binaries in ./dist/built/lisper/*
6. `$ cabal repl` will give you a shell with the project imported
7. The top level function `exec` takes a string as argument and returns the
   evaluated result. Eg: `> exec "(define (add x y) (+ x y)) (add 1 2))` will
   print 3.
