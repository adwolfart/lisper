* Lisper

[[https://travis-ci.org/jaseemabid/lisper][file:https://travis-ci.org/jaseemabid/lisper.svg?branch=master]]

A tiny *WIP* statically typed, immutable, lazy, pattern matched lisp interpreter
in haskell. A micro haskell with lisp semantics to learn Haskell as well as
lisp.

IO can be a compromise for now, I think.
