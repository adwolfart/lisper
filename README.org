* Lisper

A tiny lisp interpreter, to learn Haskell, WIP

*** Objective

Build a scheme like, but static and strongly typed, lazy pattern matched lisp.

Yes, that sounds like a tiny haskell, and its no accident. Being a lisp, you
will have obviously first class functions etc and being functional, it will be
pure. No mutable variables.

IO can be a compromise for now, I think.

*** Good to have

1. Type inference with MH

*** Feature pipeline [3/5]

- [X] A working calculator with native haskell operators
- [X] Scheme style Boolean
- [X] Pretty print quote with `
- [ ] Haskell style cons with `:`
- [ ] ML style list access with `#4`

*** Tasks, known bugs [1/6]

- [X] Allow arbitrary spaces inside sexp => `( 4 5 )`
- [ ] Allow arbitrary spaces outside sexp => `   (+ 4 5)  `
- [ ] Support escaping strings
- [ ] Support escape sequences
- [ ] Add a Character constructor to LispVal
- [ ] Add a Float constructor
